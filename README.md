# TensorFlowAlexnet

The provided files include a TensorFlow implementation of Alexnet [1], using the Python API for TensorFlow. The implementation is a reproduction of a tfleran based implementation [2], built on top of Tensorflow. However, using tflearn obscures implementation details. Therefore, this implementation has been written using tensorflow directly.

Feedback is welcome. Please Email to rotem.mairon@gmail.com
